-   somehow prompt user to scroll
-   bio portion could show climbing/trail running, anatomy academy and coaching?
-   Freeze diamond animation
-   floating nav minimap to jump to projects
-   Each Project paragraph should be a Tile that has tech-stack icons and screenshot of app. There should be a link to the github somewhere and deployable, if there is one. The tile should be expandable on click with a nice animation.
