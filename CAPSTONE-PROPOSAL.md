Name of Student: Austin Papritz

Name of Project: Portfolio Splash Page Cinematic in Three.js

Project's Purpose or Goal: Welcome users to my portfolio with a cinematic sequence

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Moving parts and effects
- Incorporating my name/face/avatar/logo
- Animation should settle into a pleasant but dynamic equilibrium
- Prompt user to enter or continue scrolling

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- React
- Three.js
- OpenGL
- React 3 Fiber, Drei
- Docs for Three.js, R3f, Drei
- Three.js subreddit

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Each level integrates more Three.js:

1. Include pre-made Three.js components on an otherwise static webpage
2. Refactor portfolio in Three.js and project HTML elements on to planar geometries
3. Refactor portfolio to make a cohesive dynamic Three.js experience
   - All/most elements dynamically react to user input (scrolling, clicking etc.)
4. Add custom Three.js elements made in Blender

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- threejs-journey.com
- deeply analyzing code samples from React 3 Fiber and Drei docs

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
